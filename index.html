            <div class="information">
                <p>In 1881, Governor Cadwallader C. Washburn gave his Edgewood Villa and 55-acre wooded estate on the shore of Lake Wingra to the Dominican Sisters of Sinsinawa. They moved St. Regina Academy, which had been located in downtown Madison, to the Edgewood site and, after a tragic fire in 1893, rebuilt the school as Sacred Heart Academy, which was later separated into Edgewood High School and Edgewood Campus School.</p>
                <p>In 1927, Edgewood College was founded as a junior college for women with a two-year liberal arts curriculum, housed in the same building as the high school. The senior college developed in 1940, focusing on the preparation of teachers, and the first Bachelor of Science degrees in education were awarded in 1942. Marshall Hall, originally built in 1864, was converted for use as a college residence hall in 1941–42, becoming the first distinctively collegiate building separate from the high school facilities.</p>
